=head1 HP35S scientific calculator

An assembler C<src/asm2hpc.pl> prepares the programs for HP35s. Assembler programs (C<*.asm>) benefit from the symbolic resolution of labels, named constants and simple macro functions.

Perl (C<*.pl> or C<*.pm>) is used as the implementation language for the assembler.

The I<machine code> is not directly available, a well-formatted, ready-to-use format (C<*.txt> option C<-p> or C<*.35s> option C<-u>) with all numbered lines, all labels and jump labels (option C<-j>) is required.

The associated key commands can optionally be output as a comment by the assembler (option C<-s>).

It can be very helpful to import the source code (C<*.asm>) into the emulator (C<*.ep>) using macros to test the program logic (C<marcos/*.mac> option C<-e>).
